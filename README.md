## Green-Greener-Greenest

The game is composed of three different smaller games, all following the same basic ruleset.

## Green

**Green** is the first game of the Green-Greener-Greenest set. Green is a game for 3 players derived from The House of the Flying Blades and brother game of RED and BLUE, by the same designer, that uses a non-transitive capturing mechanism.

The board starts full of pyramids. Players in turn capture (mandatory) other pyramids or stacks of pyramids orthogonally so that:

- Black can only capture Green
- Green can only capture White
- White can only capture Black

The game ends when all players pass in succession. The player with the highest combined height of controlled stacks wins the game.

## Greener

**Greener** is a capturing game for 2 players, where both must capture the same colour.

Depending on the set, you’d have:

Basic: a 6×6 board, 15 black pyramids, 20 green pyramids, 15 white pyramids.

Advanced: a 6×9 – 9×9 board (using one or both pads), 30 black pyramids, 45 green pyramids, 30 white pyramids.

Gameplay overview:

The board starts full of pyramids. Players take turns capturing pyramids or stacks of any colour orthogonally.

The game ends when all players pass in succession. The player with the most green pyramids captured (being part of stacks they control) wins the game. In case of a tie, the player with the highest stack wins. If the tie persists, play again.

Please refer to the rulebook for detailed rules.

## Greenest

**Greenest** is a solo game.

Setup the board as in Green. The goal of the game is to end up with a single stack, by making captures also as in Green (Black can only capture Green and so on), but in any order. This is, you can capture several times with the same colour, or reverse the order.

Whether all initial configurations are solvable or not still remains an open question. Your feedback on this will be greatly appreciated.
